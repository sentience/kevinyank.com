In [Subspace Radio #67](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-67-space-stations-ld-5x05-starbase-80), Rob and I admire the graffiti and rusty TOS-era decor of Starbase 80 in "Starbase 80?!", then revisit two of our favorite space stations from the past, Deep Space Station K-7 (from "The Trouble With Tribbles" (TOS)) and Deep Space 9 (from â€¦ Deep Space Nine!).
