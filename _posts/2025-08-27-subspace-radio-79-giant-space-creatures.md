In [Subspace Radio #79](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-79-giant-space-creatures-snw-3x07-what-is-starfleet), Rob and I dodge oddly insistent questions about what it's like to kill a person in order to discuss the relative merits of "What is Starfleet?" (SNW). Inspired by this episode's "space dragon", we revisit a couple of other giant space creatures of episodes past, in "Datalore" and "Silicon Avatar" (TNG), and "Tin Man" (TNG).
