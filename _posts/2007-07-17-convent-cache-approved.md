<p>I met briefly with Maggie Maguire, CEO of the <a href="http://www.abbotsfordconvent.com.au/">Abbotsford Convent</a> today about my interest in placing a <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">geocache</a> on the Convent grounds. On the way, I stopped to pick up <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCXABB">Down on the Farm</a>, a popular cache at nearby <a href="http://www.farm.org.au/">Collingwood Children’s Farm</a>, to take with me to the meeting.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-163"></a>Ms. Maguire seemed resistant to the idea at first, but was curious enough to ask where I would imagine placing the cache. After I’d outlined some of the considerations for placing a cache, she seemed a little confused, and asked “Just how big is it?”</p>
<p>I pulled the small, one-litre plastic container out of my bag, placed it on the table, and explained that it was actually a fairly large cache by urban standards. She relaxed visibly. “That’s the whole thing?” she wondered as I opened it up and showed her the contents.</p>
<p>It seems that when I’d originally described geocaches as “small containers”, she had immediately thought of <a href="http://www.abbotsfordconvent.com.au/community/artists/monkeys_solar_studio">Monkey’s solar studio</a>, a solar-powered recording studio housed in a standard shipping container in a secluded corner of the Convent property. I guess “small” is a relative term!</p>
<p>Once she understood that all we were talking about was a little plastic container, Ms. Maguire warmed to the idea immediately, expressing her amazement that geocaching was indeed a popular pastime. “I think it’s very cute,” she said more than once.</p>
<p>Before I left, she offered several good ideas for where the cache might be placed, and what other features of the Convent the clues for finding it might involve. Now I need to take a walk around the Convent to find a good spot.</p>
