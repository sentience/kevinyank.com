In [Subspace Radio #72](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-72-unreasonable-klingon-ships-ld-5x10-the-new-next-generation), Rob and I surf the waves of the multiverse, dodging Klingon death barges in "The New Next Generation". We then look to the past for other examples of unreasonable Klingon ships, and find the overlooked classic, "A Matter of Honor" (TNG).
