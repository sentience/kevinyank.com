In [Subspace Radio #80](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-80-exes-snw-3x08-four-and-a-half-vulcans), Rob and I play cartoon versions of Vulcan versions of ourselves with the help of our exes in "Four-and-a-Half Vulcans" (SNW). We then revisit past episodes where post-relationship relationships figured prominently in the stories of Starfleet officers, including "Haven" (TNG) and "Rejoined" (DS9).
