In [Subspace Radio #82](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-82-pure-evil-snw-3x10-new-life-and-new-civilizations), Rob and I agree the "log cabin timeline" is a nicer place to live than the rest of the Strange New Worlds season three finale, "New Life and New Civilizations" (SNW). On the bright side, perhaps it will be the last time that "pure evil" is used as a plot device for awhile. We can only hope. Taking this last opportunity, we revisit other examples of evil in its purest form: "Skin of Evil" (TNG) and "The Most Toys" (TNG).
