<p>There are three Sundays left in <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/">Impro Melbourne</a>'s Theatresports™ season, and at this point its looking like I'll appear in all three shows, but if you were hoping to see me and Jess play this year your time is running out! Tickets for the Grand Final on November 26th are sold out, and November 12th and 19th each have only a handful of seats remaining.</p>
<p>We'd love to see some familiar faces in the audience over the next couple of weeks. Book now while you can!</p>
