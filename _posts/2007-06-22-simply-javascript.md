  content: "@Rob\nYou won't be disappointed.\n\nThis book was a pure joy to read.
    Excellent code, wonderful writing styles, and beautiful illustrations to boot.
    \n\nI especially appreciated the coverage of the libraries (and their shortcomings)
    and the quality of the code throughout the book. You stuck to a standard and refused
    to take shortcuts (such as innerHTML). I know that this is a discussion for another
    time, and that there may be legitimate uses - but I enjoyed the cleanliness of
    your code. \n\nNice work Kevin and Cameron!"

    and I would like to thank you because your book was very easy to read and now
    I'm making a dinamic website. Thanks a lot! You're great! By Chris from Tuscany!

  content: This has to be the best introduction to JavaScript I've ever read - and
    I've read a lot them! I won't use this space to compare to other titles are expound
    at length - I'll save that for MY blog ;) - but I will say, if you have not read
    a JS title yet, this is an excellent one to start with.

    Hey Kevin ... I was going to Dtweet you something like "Living in Oz, working for SitePoint; gotta luv being Canadian! *grin*" but couldn't ... you aren't following me ... HeyHo.

    Anyhow, you said something about "to space or not to space before version number" and I was wondering if you're assembling a spec. I had to do one ... I mean a real one ... I mean a MIL-SPEC avionics R&amp;D one ... and would love to hoe in on something for this day and age.

    hope to connect with you

  content: "I have a quick suggestion to make it even better. Some of your examples
    (even in the first chapter) still assume basic understanding of Javascript. My
    suggestion would be... \n1) When using a figure (diagram) to explain a piece of
    code, put the line of code beside the element of the diagram that it pertains
    to.  \n2) Whenever possible use a \"Real Life\" event to demonstrate the code.
    (such as, If you hit the snooze button on the alarm in the morning, you are creating
    a \"Loop\" until you either shut off the alarm or get up.)\n3)Give a website location
    that uses the element of code you are discussing, let the reader see the code
    in action and it will make a lot more sense then just reading something on the
    page."

<p>It’s aliiiiiiiiiive! The first copies of <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/launch/cf0b72">Simply JavaScript</a>—SitePoint’s latest book, co-written by me and <a href="http://themaninblue.com/">Cameron Adams</a>—have arrived! And if you’ll forgive my obvious bias, it looks awesome.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-161"></a>I’m so proud of what Cameron and I have achieved with this book. We knew from the beginning that it wasn’t worthwhile writing another beginner’s JavaScript book unless we could produce something really special, and we definitely have.</p>
<p>Simply JavaScript teaches the technology with unprecedented clarity, featuring loads of colour illustrations and advice on how to use JavaScript the right way in the real world.</p>
<p>It’s also a surprisingly entertaining read, although I'll admit our sense of humor is a little odd at times. On one occasion, we had to fight to keep a joke in when the proofreader had crossed it out with the note “not funny” in the margin. All the same, I daresay it’s the funniest book SitePoint has published to date, which is saying a lot!</p>
<p>Plenty more details in <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/newsletter/viewissue.php?id=3&issue=167">Tech Times #167</a> and <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/launch/cf0b72">SitePoint</a>.</p>
