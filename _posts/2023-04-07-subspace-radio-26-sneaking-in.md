In [Subspace Radio #26](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-26-sneaking-in-pic-3x06-dominion), Rob and I both wish that the production of Star Trek: Picard Season 3 could have afforded just one more set this week as a very special Klingon Bird-of-Prey makes its return to the screen in "The Bounty". After watching a small team infiltrate Daystrom Station, we reflect on other times our intrepid crews have sneaked in where they didn't belong, including "Chain Of Command, Part I" (TNG), "By Inferno's Light" (DS9), "Change Of Heart" (DS9), and "Extreme Measures" (DS9).
