In [Subspace Radio #74](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-74-bartenders-snw-3x01-02), Rob and I are back to visit Strange New Worlds, some of which look suspiciously like episodes of a TV show from the 60s. After sharing highlights from "Hegemony, Part II" and "Wedding Bell Blues", we pull up a stool and talk about our favourite bartenders â€¦ one of whom you probably can't guess!
