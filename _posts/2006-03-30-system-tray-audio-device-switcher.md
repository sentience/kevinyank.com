excerpt: "I actively use both a Bluetooth headset (a <a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/AU/EN,CRID=1628,CONTENTID=9473\">Logitech®
  Mobile Pro™</a>) and a <a href=\"http://www.tweakheadz.com/review_of_the_rode_nt1.htm\">Rode
  NT1 microphone</a> on my computer. The headset I use for making and taking Skype
  calls and listening to podcasts at home, while the microphone I use for narrating
  video tutorials and recording podcasts. The problem is, switching between these
  audio sources is a minor pain (which becomes a major pain through repitition), requiring
  a trip to the Control Panel every time.\r\n\r\nThankfully, I've found this free
  utility called, in various places, <a href=\"http://www.simtel.net/product.php%5Burl_fb_product_page%5D74517\">System
  Tray Audio Device Switcher</a>, SysADS, SADS, and System Tray Audio Device Manager.
  It lives in my Windows system tray and allows me to select my playback and recording
  device with just a couple of clicks. The program hasn't been updated since its release
  in 2003, but it works on Windows XP SP2 just fine (I'm not holding my breath that
  it'll work quite so well in Vista, however).\r\n\r\n"

  content: hey, this information was actually helpful to me! (Like you I have multiple
    audio devices -- skype on bluetooth headset, regular speakers for music (through
    a usb external soundcard), regular headphones on internal sound card). Thanks
    for putting this information up. ;)

    STADS. \r\nBut I like the QuickSoundSwitch much more because it offers much more

    Tray Audio Device Manager 1.0 still seems to be down anyway.. is there any other
    location to download it?"

  content: Thanks!  Link seems to be working again...I'm gonna try both QuickSoundSwitch
    and STAD to see which one is better although both are probably equally good. The
    only difference I've heard so far is that Quicksoundswitch is just a simple .exe
    app that does not need to be installed.

    shortcuts of your Games &amp; Apps to switch and adjust the Soundcard automatically
    just before the program starts up. \r\nIt also suports Hotkeys now... \r\nThis
    Version already looks quite good to me ;)\r\n\r\nBut, I still can not download
    STAD I guess the link is dead again, so I can not compare..."

    in the Main-screen) .. the new Version has some really nice new features..  specially
    the Niknames have been on my wishlist ;-)\r\n\r\nRegarding your Download-Question
    you can dl STADS here:\r\nhttp://www.mp3vcr.com/stads/\r\n\r\nBut STADS is really
    poor compared with the Quick Sound Switch (specially because its 20 times bigger).
    \ \r\nAlso STADS seems to have some problems with Web-Cams  (its showing my Webcam
    in the Soundcard - List) \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm happy with the QSS..just hope it
    also works on Windows Vista..   ;-)"

    Canadians are awesome!

    Found this page looking for such an app through google

    It would be great to have an app that lets you change the recording source faster too.

    E.g: Mic In, Line In, Stereo Mix/Wave out etc.....


    its such a chore to do it normally.
    you must go into volume control, click options, properties, click recording, click okay, then tick the source you want!

    ughh!

    Thanks for the page.

    programs for Vista and they will not work in Vista. However, this program works
    for Vista, works great and is actively updated and maintanced. Please ask Ryan
    to add changing for Recording (Mic etc) as well. I have requested this feature
    but if more people request, Ryan might consider adding it. Here is the link: http://www.vistaaudiochanger.com/"

    reduced my weight thirty  pounds in thirty  days, and I am excited to share my
    weight loss success with as many people as possible. If I can lose weight then
    any one can. Whatever you do, never give up and you WILL achieve all your weight
    loss targets!

  content: As others have noticed Vista Audio Changer doesn't work for Windows 7.
    I'd recommend Coastal Audio Changer - http://coastalaudiochanger.wordpress.com/.
    It is $5 for the full version but there is active development from the guy behind
    it.

<p>I actively use both a Bluetooth headset (a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/AU/EN,CRID=1628,CONTENTID=9473">Logitech® Mobile Pro™</a>) and a <a href="http://www.tweakheadz.com/review_of_the_rode_nt1.htm">Rode NT1 microphone</a> on my computer. The headset I use for making and taking Skype calls and listening to podcasts at home, while the microphone I use for narrating video tutorials and recording podcasts. The problem is, switching between these audio sources is a minor pain (which becomes a major pain through repitition), requiring a trip to the Control Panel every time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I've found this free utility called, in various places, <a href="http://www.simtel.net/product.php%5Burl_fb_product_page%5D74517">System Tray Audio Device Switcher</a>, SysADS, SADS, and System Tray Audio Device Manager. It lives in my Windows system tray and allows me to select my playback and recording device with just a couple of clicks. The program hasn't been updated since its release in 2003, but it works on Windows XP SP2 just fine (I'm not holding my breath that it'll work quite so well in Vista, however).</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-63"></a>Even with this utility, most Windows programs can't switch audio devices while running. Windows Media Player, for example, will latch onto the selected playback device when it starts up, and will continue outputting to it even if you switch devices while it's running. More flexible programs like Skype <em>do</em> allow you to switch devices at any time, but only by overriding the system default device in the program's own settings.</p>
<p>In short, this utility does save me the trip to the Control Panel to change audio devices, but I still need to restart any audio programs I may have already open in order for the switch to affect them.</p>
<p>Here's hoping things get better, not worse, in Vista.</p>
