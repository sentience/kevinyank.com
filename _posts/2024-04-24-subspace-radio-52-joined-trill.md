In [Subspace Radio #52](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-52-joined-trill-dis-5x03-jinaal), after defeating the cloak-bees of the dimly-lit rock quarries of Trill, Rob and I take a stroll down the lane (or a swim up the milky river?) of Trill history, discussing all of the joined Trill that we have encountered in our travels. We discuss "Facets" (DS9), "Rejoined" (DS9) and "The Host" (TNG).
