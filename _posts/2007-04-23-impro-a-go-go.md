    Hi Kevin,

    I'm rather new to impro (or, impro is still pretty new to me), but I saw you perform at Theatresports last year and I was in the audience of the "Smells like a Song" preview on Tuesday. Just wanted to let you know that my brother and I really enjoyed your performance, particularly your character's intereactions with Mike Bryant's character.  My brother is still quoting your line about the vineyards!

    Congratulations, and I hope I can catch one of your performances in "Unforeseen Stories".

<p>Having recently <a href="https://kevinyank.com/posts/joining-the-impro-melbourne-ensemble">joined the ranks</a> of <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/">Impro Melbourne</a>'s talented ensemble, this was the first Festival where I took to the stage! Joining on opening night the cast of Impro Melbourne's production of <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/shows/smells2007"><cite>Smells Like a Song</cite></a> was a privilege … not to mention a blast!</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-148"></a>Making the occasion extra special, my parents had arrived in town just in time to see me in an impro show for the first time—an improvised <em>musical</em>, no less! The pressure was on, but as always happens when I hit the stage to improvise, my mind went blank and I forgot they were even there.</p>
<p>Although <cite>Smells</cite> went on to have better nights (including a closing night that nearly brought the house down), it seems my new blood made a good impression on my fellow improvisers, because I've since been cast rather heavily in the upcoming season of <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/shows/longform2007"><cite>Unforeseen Stories</cite></a>,<a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/shows/longform2007"><img align="right" alt="Unforeseen Stories" id="image150" title="Unforeseen Stories" style="clear: right" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/unforeseen2007.jpg" /></a> which starts next week, hot on the heels of the Festival!</p>
<p>But by far the greatest moment of this Festival for me was the "Impro Love-In Jam" organized by <a href="http://www.lliamamor.com/">Lliam Amor</a> and <a href="http://www.janellekoenig.com/">Janelle Koenig</a>, where all the Australian improvisers in the festival were invited to rub elbows, play games and shout each other drinks. The three hours sped by, and a few new bridges were built between Melbourne's traditionally insular impro companies.</p>
