In [Subspace Radio #28](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-28-we-hardly-knew-ye-pic-3x08-surrender), Rob and I find a lot to talk about in "Surrender", an episode where relatively little happened. Vadic's sudden decision to phaser a member of the bridge crew whose name we hadn't even heard before leads us to contemplate other times background characters made the ultimate sacrifice and made an impression (or didn't) in the process. From Voyager we discuss Hogan ("Basics, Part II"), Pete Durst ("Faces"), and Joe Carey ("Friendship One"). Then we bemoan the wasted opportunity of that was Discovery's Airiam ("Project Daedalus").
