In [Subspace Radio #76](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-76-horror-snw-3x04-a-space-adventure-hour), Rob and I sneak onto a Holodeck that shouldn't be invented for eighty years or so to question characters playing parodies of past podcast hosts you might recognize. Also we talk about "A Space Adventure Hour" (SNW). Inspired by its surprise appearance in this era, we return to holodeck episodes past for a second time, reflecting on "The Big Goodbye" (TNG), "Hollow Pursuits" (TNG), "Fair Haven" (VOY) and "Spirit Folk" (VOY).
