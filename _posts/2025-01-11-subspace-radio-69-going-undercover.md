In [Subspace Radio #69](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-69-going-undercover-ld-5x07-fully-dilated), Rob and I don our fake antennae and pose as local yokels as we spend twelve months trapped on a primitive planet watching "Fully Dilated". We then explore other times our Starfleet crews have hidden in plain sight, disguised as members of an alien world, including "The Enterprise Incident" (TOS), "In the Flesh" (VOY), "First Contact" (TNG) and "Face of the Enemy" (TNG).
