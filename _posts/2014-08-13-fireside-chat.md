This Thursday, August 14th, I’ll be speaking at the [Melbourne Web Developers meetup][meetup] in a “fireside chat” with event organiser James Gallichio from [General Assembly][ga].

The theme of the night is “show me something amazing” (no pressure), so I’m bringing along a few examples of web development that has inspired me lately. I’ll also be speaking about how I got into web development, my years at [SitePoint][sp] and [Learnable][l], how web development has changed over the years and where it’s going next.

Hope to see you there!
