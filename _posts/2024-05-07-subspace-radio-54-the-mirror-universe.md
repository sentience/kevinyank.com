In [Subspace Radio #54](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-54-the-mirror-universe-dis-5x05-mirrors), we switch on the holographic blind on our Breen loading dock to discuss "Mirrors", which turned out not to be quite the contribution to Mirror Universe lore we were expecting. To make up for it, we revisit all the other appearances of the Mirror Universe, including "Mirror, Mirror" (TOS), "Crossover" (DS9), "Through the Looking Glass" (DS9), "Shattered Mirror" (DS9), "Resurrection" (DS9), "The Emperor's New Cloak" (DS9), and "In a Mirror, Darkly, Parts I & II" (ENT). We also briefly reflect (!) on Discovery's sojourn in the Mirror Universe in season one of that show.
