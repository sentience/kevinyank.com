With a bonus episode of Star Trek comes a bonus episode of Subspace Radio! In [Subspace Radio #37](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-37-activating-alien-artifacts-snw-2x07-those-old-scientists), Rob and I would happily give several kilograms of heronium to get to see "Those Old Scientists" again for the first time. We talk through this crossover episode that had no business being as good as it was, before seeking out other examples of alien artifacts, including "Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad" (DIS) and "The Paradise Syndrome" (TOS).
