In [Subspace Radio #50](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-50-star-trek-v-commentary), to celebrate our fiftieth episode, we break from our usual format to record an audio commentary for [Star Trek V: The Final Frontier](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_V:_The_Final_Frontier), arguably the least successful Star Trek film, but not without its charms (and an especially charming Vulcan!).

We'll return with more Subspace Radio when new Trek returns to our screens in April for Star Trek: Discovery's final season. Until then, see you 'round the galaxy!
