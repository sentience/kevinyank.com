In [Subspace Radio #88](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-88-alone-on-the-bridge-sa-1x07-kozeine), Rob and I agree to be each other's best men to pass the time while reflecting on "Ko'Zeine" (SA), then discuss past episodes where characters found themselves alone on the bridge of a starship: "The Mark of Gideon" (TOS), "One" (VOY), "Relics" (TNG), and "Singularity" (ENT).
