  initiative and went prowling through a couple of the cookbooks I keep on the shelf

    Happy Birthday Big Guy.
    Now get into that kitchen and rattle them pots and pans...in the gutter.

<p>I was at a day-long impro workshop on Sunday when someone asked me, "Where's Jess today?" I realized how strange it would sound before I answered. "She's at home making my dinner."</p>
<p>Jess and I have been busy people lately, which means we haven't had much time to spice things up. In the kitchen, I mean. Get your mind out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Well, with a couple of days off this week, Jess took the initiative and went prowling through a couple of the cookbooks I keep on the shelf (gotta keep up appearances, you know).</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-66"></a> <img align="right" title="Tortilla Pie" id="image65" alt="Tortilla Pie" src="http://old.kevinyank.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/makemydinner.jpg" />Together we picked out four dishes and added all the exotic ingredients (potatoes, ooh!) to the shopping list.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jess made us potato and corn chowder just like mom used to make... only with prawns. Can't say I relished the addition of seafood to a perfectly good carb-fest, but it was my nod to the adventurous spirit of the undertaking. Then on Monday night she cooked up this magnificent tortilla pie.</p>
<p>Look, I'm as progressively-minded a guy as you're likely to find, so yes, I'm feeling a mite guilty that Jess is suddenly cooking all the meals single-handedly. But I'm rationalizing it as a week-long celebration around  my birthday. Next week, I'll be only too happy to step up at dinner time and defrost some fish sticks, or open a lovely can of chunky soup. Yum!</p>
