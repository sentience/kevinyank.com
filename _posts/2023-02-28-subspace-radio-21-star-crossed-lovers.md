In [Subspace Radio #21](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-21-star-crossed-lovers-pic-3x01-the-next-generation), Rob and I greet the season three premiere of Star Trek: Picard with cautious optimism, then notice the number of broken romances strewn about the place in a single episode. We take the opportunity to revisit other loves lost from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, In Theory (TNG), Star Trek: Insurrection, and Star Trek: Enterprise.
