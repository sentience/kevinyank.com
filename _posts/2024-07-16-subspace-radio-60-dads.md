In [Subspace Radio #60](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-60-dads-pro-2x01-05), Rob and I plunge into Season 2 of Star Trek: Prodigy like Rok-Tahk and Murf jumping into Gillian's tank! We share our thoughts on "Into the Breach, Part I & II", "Who Saves the Saviors", "Temporal Mechanics 101", and "Observer's Paradox", before focusing on fathers in Star Trek, including "The Icarus Factor" (TNG) and the relationships between Joseph, Benjamin and Jake Sisko (DS9).
