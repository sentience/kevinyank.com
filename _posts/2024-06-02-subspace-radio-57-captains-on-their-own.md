In [Subspace Radio #57](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-57-captains-on-their-own-dis-5x08-labyrinths), Rob and I are trapped in our separate mindscapes, with only a cryptic librarian version of the other for company. To pass the time, we consider how "Labyrinths" compares to other times starship captain have had to work solo, without their ship or crew. We discuss "Arena" (TOS), "Starship Mine" (TNG), "The Inner Light" (TNG), and "Resistance" (VOY).
