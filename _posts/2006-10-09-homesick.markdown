    Awww, Kev, well at least you made the flight. I'm keeping good thoughts that your return trip home has been smooth. Hopefully, you'll have a few days to sleep it off, too.

    By the way, if you have a little cold and cough, don't blame me.

<p>I'm in Singapore enjoying the free Internet on my way back to Melbourne. I almost didn't make my flight in London, which was overbooked, but I see I've been <a href="http://www.molly.com/2006/10/08/somewhere-outside-london/">luckier than some</a>. Sorry to hear you got stuck again, Molly!</p>
