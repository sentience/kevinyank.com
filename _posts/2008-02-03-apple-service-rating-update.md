  content: "I had a similar experience with another Canadian service center in Calgary.
    A DOA keyboard had to be ordered as a replacement part, even though they had identical
    keyboards on the shelf, for sale, in the store section, 5 feet away.\r\n\r\nA
    week later I got a call saying the replacement keyboard was in and if I didn't
    pick it up by noon tomorrow it would be sent back.\r\n\r\nWTF! I know this store
    quite well. Been dealing there for years and years. They would not have done this
    to any customer. They would have given me a replacement off the shelf if they
    could have. This is Apple's draconian service policy at work. Apple must think
    a lot of independent service centers are ripping them off. Either that or the
    costs must be reduced because the profit margin and the stock price are more important
    than customer satisfaction."

<p>For those who’ve asked, here’s an update on the <a href="https://kevinyank.com/posts/streetwises-service-rating-harms-customer-service">situation</a> with <a href="http://www.streetwise.com.au/">Streetwise</a> and the Apple Service Rating that I wrote about in <a href="https://kevinyank.com/posts/streetwises-service-rating-harms-customer-service">my last post</a>.</p>
<p>Streetwise replied almost immediately to my <a href="https://kevinyank.com/posts/streetwises-service-rating-harms-customer-service">email complaint</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>I'm not sure why the technician on Saturday would have told you that - perhaps there was some sort of misunderstanding.<br />
I do apologise if you felt that was inappropriate in anyway.<br />
I can confirm that the part to be fitted would not be an issue and you can use your machine normally while we wait for the part.<br />
As the technician is not in today - I will discuss the matter with him when I see him and to see if we can resolve this one way or another.<br />
We will attempt to call or leave a message when the part actually comes in. Do you wish me to order the part for you?</p>
<p>Best Wishes,<br />
Gary Chee<br />
Service &amp; Returns Manager
</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite the reversal. I asked Streetwise to go ahead and order the part. Two days later:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>The top case has arrived today. Could you please drop off your Macbook so we can install it for you?<br />
Please allow us at least half a day turn around time to sort it out for you.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Gary
</p></blockquote>
<p>Still no explanation for the original incident, you’ll note. I queried this in my reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thanks. Will do!</p>
<p>Has any explanation for the original mixup been forthcoming?</p>
<p>--<br />

</p></blockquote>
<p>Streetwise’s reply was about as vague as can be, but reading between the lines I believe my complaint was taken to heart:</p>
<blockquote><p>No worries Kevin - I've spoken to the tech and he said there was a small mixup - but I hope that's been cleared up.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Gary</p></blockquote>
<p>The repair was completed the same day I dropped off the computer. In total, I was without my MacBook for about four hours. Not bad at all!</p>
<p>The next day, I received an automated email from Apple requesting my feedback on the support experience I had had with Streetwise. As you can imagine, I was very forthcoming, and ticked the box that said ‘You may contact me for more information about my experience’. Two months later, I have not heard from Apple on the matter.</p>
