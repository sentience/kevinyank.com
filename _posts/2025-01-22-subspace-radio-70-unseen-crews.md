In [Subspace Radio #70](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-70-unseen-crews-ld-5x08-upper-decks), Rob and I step out of the limelight to make way for some junior podcasters to talk about us behind our backs as we discuss "Upper Decks". We then revisit two other episodes where previously-unseen groups of crew members are the stars of the show, "Learning Curve" (VOY) and "Lower Decks" (TNG).
