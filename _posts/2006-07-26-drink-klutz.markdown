<p>Apparently in the US I'm a klutz with drinks.</p>
<p>Yesterday at lunch with Nathan and Casey in Olympia, a glass of ice water slipped out of my hand, tipped over, and poured itself across the restaurant table and onto my lap. I had to hang up my jeans in the sun all afternoon to dry the front.</p>
<p>Then, that same night at dinner (again, with Nathan and Casey), I did the exact same thing with a large glass of root beer. Nathan's stepdaughter Hayden laughed giddily at my sticky predicament. Jess was suitably mortified.</p>
<p>Then today, on my way to the evening sessions at <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/os2006/">OSCON</a> in Portland, I stepped off a curb and into a sewer grating, and in regaining my balance dumped half of the Dr. Pepper I had just bought from Subway down my arm.</p>
<p>For those keeping score at home, that's three self-drenchings in 24 hours. Is there a name for this syndrome?</p>
