In [Subspace Radio #39](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-39-camp-trek-snw-2x09-subspace-rhapsody), Rob and I agree that "Subspace Rhapsody" had its charms, but didn't quite live up to the hype, and that its best moment was a scene without a song at all! Taking the cue of this musical episode, we both agree that "Bride of Chaotica!" (VOY) is the last time going over the top into silliness was the point of an episode, and we talk through its highlights in detail. Finally, as a bonus, Rob re-watched Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and was surprised by how much he enjoyed it!
