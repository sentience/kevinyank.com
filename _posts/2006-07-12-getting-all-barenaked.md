<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.bnlmusic.com/">Barenaked Ladies</a>. Not only do they make music I dig, but they've got an <a href="https://kevinyank.com/posts/music-copyright-laid-bare/">enlightened approach</a> to user rights, and there is a geeky vein through all of the work they do (I refer you to their <a href="http://www.bnlblog.com/">blog</a> and <a href="http://bnlmusic.com/">podcast</a>).</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="Barenaked Ladies Are Me cover art" id="image101" title="Barenaked Ladies Are Me cover art" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/BNL.AreMe.jpg" />But with the pending release of their new album, <cite>Barenaked Ladies Are Me</cite>, they have slipped up a little. It seems they have produced so much new music for this album, that they are going to make different subsets available through different methods of distribution.</p>
<p>From the announcement email:</p>
<blockquote><p>Order before Aug 22nd and receive as a bonus the "BNL: All New Revue (Live from the Glenn Gould Theatre)" disc FREE, which is a live acoustic version of the new album.</p>
<p>[The album's 13 tracks] will also be available digitally with a bonus of two tracks for purchase of the entire album. In addition, a 25 song package called Barenaked Ladies Are Me: Deluxe Edition, will be available digitally (album only). With the purchase of the Deluxe Edition, fans will be have the opportunity to obtain either two bonus tracks OR four bonus tracks for pre-ordering. Details on the digital pre-order to follow.</p>
<p>In addtion, a USB stick featuring 29 songs plus other special content will be released Sept 12.</p></blockquote>
<p>Confused yet? This is more complicated than <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/versions/">picking an edition of Windows Vista</a>!</p>
<p>As a loyal fan, I want to know one thing: how do I get all the Barenaked goodness that I can without paying for most of it twice (or three times!)?</p>
