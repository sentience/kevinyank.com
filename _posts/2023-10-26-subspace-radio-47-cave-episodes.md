In [Subspace Radio #47](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-47-cave-episodes-ld-4x08-caves), Rob and I get stuck in a cave and are forced to pass the time awaiting rescue discussing "Caves". As our supplies dwindle, we plumb the hidden depths of other cave-based episodes from Star Trek history, including "The Devil in the Dark" (TOS), "Heart of Stone" (DS9), "Final Mission" (TNG), and "Waltz" (DS9).
