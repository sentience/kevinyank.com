In [Subspace Radio #63](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-63-kids-pro-2x16-20), Rob and I farewell the newly-formed Prodigy crew in episodes 16-20 of season two, then take the opportunity to revisit past instances of children in Star Trek, both stories about children including "Miri" (TOS), "And the Children Shall Lead" (TOS), and "When the Bough Breaks" (TNG), as well as fully-formed characters who are kids including Wesley Crusher, Jake Sisko, Nog, Alexander Rozhenko, Molly O'Brien, Naomi Wildman and Icheb. Finally, we look ahead briefly to the upcoming Starfleet Academy series.
