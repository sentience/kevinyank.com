In [Subspace Radio #43](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-43-wedding-traditions-ld-4x04-something-borrowed-something-green), Rob and I are swept away in the romance (and the repeated stabbings) of "Something Borrowed, Something Green", and narrowly avoid the "hump dungeon" on our way to exploring other wedding traditions in Star Trek, including "Data's Day" (TNG) and "You Are Cordially Invited" (DS9).
