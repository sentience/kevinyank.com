<p>Although the show started last weekend, the first one I'm in is tonight, so I have selfishly waited until now to announce it.</p>
<p><cite>Tangents</cite> is a show I helped develop over the past few months at Impro Melbourne, and it's very exciting to finally get to show it to the masses.</p>
<p>Two strangers meet at a party and strike up a conversation. The show follows the swirling, weaving, and intersecting paths of that conversation, conjuring scenes out of the subtext to reveal what these strangers might <em>really</em> be thinking.</p>
<p>Come one, come all! I'm playing tonight and next Sunday.</p>
