  content: "There is the premise that wifi networks be free and accessible, and many
    apparently agree and are considering and doing just that, including governments.
    \nGood for them!\n\nThe idea seems to have similarities with public libraries
    and education, community centres, and open source/libre software, like Linux or
    Firefox.\n\nWhen I go wireless, I am hoping it will prove feasible to leave it
    freely accessible, such as when it is not in use by my household.\nI like the
    idea of helping a neighbor surf the world's largest information repository. To
    me, it just feels right, and like a community. \n\nI also imagine your mom and
    dad would agree.\n\nOO"

  content: "The increasing popularity of wireless is becoming more evident everyday.
    \ More and more people and organizations are turning toward wireless networking
    as it becomes integrated into networking technology.\r\n\r\nMore networking techs
    are employing wireless in extending existing networks and using it as a protocol
    of choice whe setting up new networks.  Who wants to spend their time cutting,
    crimping and routing CAT5 cable through stuffy, dirty conduits when setting up
    a wireless router and signal boosters are just a matter of placing them at effective
    locations?\r\n\r\nMore municipalities are considering setting up wireless networks
    in view of the success of such ventures south of the border.\r\n\r\nHamilton,
    Ont. has proposed a motion for this endeavour.  When it will take effect is anyone's
    guess.  Unless it can actually profit someone in their municipal hierarchy, there
    doesn't seem much of a chance of it happening.  They said much of the same when
    suggesting that all telephone wiring would be replaced by fibre-optics.  This
    was about 15 -17 years ago and it's still being considered.  The only fibre-optic
    incorporated into the City's sub-structure was the Hamilton Hydro's Network because
    it was deemed an essential service.  And that's where it has stayed.\r\n\r\nPoliticians!
    \ Who needs 'em?  A waste of resources and time, if you ask me."

  content: there really is free public wifi. I know because I use it and it is called
    free public wifi plus I can access it everywhere even at school.

<p>Just got off the phone with mom and dad, who have just bought their first post-retirement home in Ottawa. Mom happened to mention she was connected to the Internet via a free wireless Internet service that was apparently available to all Ottawa residents. My envy quickly turned to skepticism, however, when she mentioned the SSID (network name) of the service she was connecting to was "netgear2".</p>
<p><a href="http://netgear.com/">NETGEAR</a> is of course a well-known manufacturer of network hardware, including wireless routers. I suspect that neighbours of my parents' simply have their home network (and associated Internet connection) sitting wide open without any security. If that's their informed choice, then great. If not, well I hope it's an old router, because there's no reason current wireless networking hardware should allow inexperienced users to expose their networks like this.</p>
<p>Mom, if you wanted to be a good neighbour, you could probably stroll around the block with your laptop and get a good idea of which house was hosting the network you are connecting to based on signal strength. A note in the mailbox advising the occupants to configure their network more securely would certainly qualify as your good turn for the day.</p>
