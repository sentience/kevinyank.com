<p>I feel like I may have some things to write about again soon.</p>
<p>Before you ask, I’m not being cagey, here. Mostly this is just a vague feeling, perhaps brought on by my recent <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sentience/sets/72157606724922524/">visit home to Canada</a>—a reminder that there are people I care about with whom I don’t communicate much (no, Facebook doesn’t count).</p>
<p>I dreamed up a fresh (but simple!) site design last night, so I broke out the Wacom to see if it worked in two dimensions. If I can keep it balanced, I think it might.</p>

<p><strong>Note to self:</strong> ask Lox if he minds me recycling his old comic book header idea.</p>
