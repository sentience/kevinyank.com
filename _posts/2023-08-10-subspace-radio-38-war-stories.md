In [Subspace Radio #38](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-38-war-stories-snw-2x08-under-the-cloak-of-war), Rob and I need a sonic shower after the slow march through the Federation-Klingon war and its ugly consequences that was "Under the Cloak of War". Reflecting on the Federation at war, we look back at "Yesterday's Enterprise" (TNG) and "The Siege of AR-558" (DS9).
