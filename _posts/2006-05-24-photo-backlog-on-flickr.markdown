<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sentience/151858186/"><img align="right" alt="Embarassing goatee photo" src="http://static.flickr.com/40/151858186_d917e04cd7_m.jpg" /></a>Would those unfortunate souls who follow my previously nonexistent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sentience/">Flickr postings</a> please avert their eyes?</p>
<p>I figured I should put that 2GB/month of storage I get from my Flickr Pro account to good use, so I've started uploading my entire library of digital photos, starting with those I took in 2000 when got my first digital camera. By and large, they are neither skillful nor pretty. What they <em>are</em> is a record of my past that I would hate to lose in the event of crime or calamity, so onto Flickr they go.</p>
<p>I promise to keep the espeically hideous ones private, and as for the rest? Well, the goatee was a passing phase. Let's leave it at that, shall we?</p>
