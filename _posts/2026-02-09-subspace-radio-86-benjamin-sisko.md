In [Subspace Radio #86](https://share.transistor.fm/s/05d8be89), Rob and I take one more turn around the pylons without vomiting glitter as we consider "Series Acclimation Mil" (SA). We then look back on the character of Benjamin Sisko, as portrayed by Avery Brooks, including memorable outings in "In the Pale Moonlight" (DS9), "The Emissary" (DS9), "Sacrifice of Angels" (DS9) and "Rapture" (DS9).
