<p>If you want to come and see me, you'll need to get off your butt because I won't be around for much of the season! I'm playing this Sunday at 7:30PM in <cite>More Or Less</cite>, a fast-paced format where players take turns directing scenes and the audience controls how long each scene goes on. Come and see me make mayhem!</p>
<p>Starting July 2nd, <cite>The Impro Cave</cite> starts earlier at 6:30PM with a brand new format called <cite>Tangents</cite> created by the up-and-comers within the Impro Melbourne company, including yours truly! More on this closer to opening night...</p>
