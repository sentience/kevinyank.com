In [Subspace Radio #53](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-53-trapped-in-time-dis-5x04-face-the-strange), Rob and I are unfazed by the time-travel shenanigans this week in "Face the Strange", accustomed as we are to weaving our way through the history of the Star Trek Universe. Inspired to revisit other times our characters became stuck revisiting other times, we discuss "Time Squared" (TNG), "The Visitor" (DS9), "Timescape" (TNG), and "Shattered" (VOY).
