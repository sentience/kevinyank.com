In [Subspace Radio #23](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-23-best-worf-moments-pic-3x03-seventeen-seconds), Rob and I agree that "Seventeen Seconds" was an episode written specifically for Rob, thanks to its loving embrace of Deep Space Nine as a core contributor to Star Trek history. Speaking of history, we take the opportunity of Worf's return to our screens to reflect on the journey of everyone's favourite son of Mogh. We touch on Redemption (TNG), Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places (DS9), Parallels (TNG), and Tacking Into the Wind (DS9).
