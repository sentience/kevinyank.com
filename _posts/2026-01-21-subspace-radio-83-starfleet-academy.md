In [Subspace Radio #83](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-83-starfleet-academy-sa-1x01-02), Rob and I emerge from regulation appearance arches, ready to fit right in among the first class of cadets to train at Starfleet Academy since the Burn. After taking in our surroundings, we discuss the recent audio drama series, “Star Trek: Khan”, and the premiere episodes of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, “Kids These Days” and “Beta Test”. We then hit the books, studying up on past appearances of the Academy grounds in “The First Duty” (TNG), “Homefront” (DS9), “In the Flesh” (VOY), "Star Trek” (2009), and “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan”.
