In [Subspace Radio #46](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-46-evil-computers-ais-ld-4x07-a-few-badgeys-more), Rob and I consult our robotic overlord for its opinion on "A Few Badgeys More", before discussing other episodes where the forces of evil aligned against our heroes were artificial in nature: "The Return of the Archons" (TOS), "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "The Ultimate Computer" (TOS) and "Prototype" (VOY). Stay after the music for our thoughts on Prodigy's new lease on life on Netflix!
