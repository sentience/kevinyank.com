<p>Just finished a first wave of customisation of the design of this blog. I'm using beta 2 of <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/k2/">the K2 theme</a>, which is quite a nice add-on for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress 2</a>.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-6"></a>Tweaking the visual styles was blissfully easy thanks to K2's support for drop-in styles (that's right---styles for a theme), but making changes to the HTML that is produced was less fun. All of K2's HTML output is hard-coded, so you need to edit K2's PHP files, which means that when K2 is updated (a significant concern due to its beta status), you need to make all your changes in the updated files again.</p>
<p>With some judicious use of a code versioning system, I should be able to make this process a bit less painful.</p>
