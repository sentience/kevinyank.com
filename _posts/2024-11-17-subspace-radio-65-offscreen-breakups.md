In [Subspace Radio #65](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-65-offscreen-breakups-ld-5x03-the-best-exotic-nanite-hotel), Rob and I enjoy the cruise ship hijinks of "The Best Exotic Nanite Hotel", then delve into other onscreen relationships that ended off screen: Scotty and Uhura (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier), Worf and Deanna Troi (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Neelix and Kes (Star Trek: Voyager) and Chakotay and Seven of Nine (Star Trek: Voyager). We also mark the passing of one of Star Trek's greatest writers, Jeri Taylor.
