In [Subspace Radio #73](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-73-moles-star-trek-section-31), Rob and I beat around the bush a bit before discussing some of the brights spots in "Star Trek: Section 31", which was otherwise a not very good Star Trek movie. We take the opportunity to discuss moles – what does or does not quality as a mole – and revisit some Deep Space Nine highlights including the abduction and replacement of Julian Bashir, "Homefront" (DS9) and "Paradise Lost" (DS9), and "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges" (DS9).
