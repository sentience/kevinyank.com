In [Subspace Radio #85](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-85-understanding-klingons-sa-1x04-vox-in-excelso), Rob and I at first refused to appear in this episode because we both suspected the other was doing us a favour, but we had a debate competition about it and agreed enough blood had been spilled for the show to go on. While searching for ways to understand Klingons, we revisit "Errand of Mercy" (TOS), "Sins of the Father" (TNG), "Reunion" (TNG), "Redemption" (TNG), and "Redemption II" (TNG), as well as "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country".
