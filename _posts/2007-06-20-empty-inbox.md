<p><img align="right" alt="Screenshot of my empty inbox" title="Screenshot of my empty inbox" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/emptyinbox.png" />Look ma – no unread email!</p>
<p>At the risk of tempting fate, I’m posting it for all to see: my email inbox is empty! This time last week, I had some 1,000 unread messages vying for my attention. Things were starting to slip through the cracks, and it was time for a big cleanup.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-159"></a>The biggest step I took in this process was to fully embrace a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD">GTD</a>-style workflow for my day-to-day work, both personal and professional. As a result, I no longer need to use my email inbox as a glorified To-do list. In other words, it’s not that I have <em>less</em> work on my plate; rather, my work just doesn’t pile up in a disorganised mess of unread email.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of software and paper systems for doing this, and everyone has their favourite. Personally, after initially selecting <a href="http://thinkingrock.com.au/">ThinkingRock</a> because it’s cross-platform and portable between my work and home computers, I’ve settled on the very slick <a href="http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/">iGTD</a>. iGTD is for Mac only, but its user interface works better for me than ThinkingRock (for now – both are under active development), and the additional system integration is worth the loss of cross-platform support now that I carry my MacBook between work and home.</p>
