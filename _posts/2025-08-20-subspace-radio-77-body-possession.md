In [Subspace Radio #77](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-77-body-possession-snw-3x05-through-the-lens-of-time), Rob and I are possessed by two entirely different manifestations of pure evil and have a knock-down, drag-out fistfight in sickbay over the slightly confusing but gratifyingly adventurous events of "Thought the Lens of Time" (SNW). Having regained our senses, we investigate other instances of body possession in "Return to Tomorrow" (TOS), "Power Play" (TNG), and "Tears of the Prophets" (DS9).
