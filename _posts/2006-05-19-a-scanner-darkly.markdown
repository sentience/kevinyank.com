<p>While I wait for the rest of the trailer to download, I thought I'd post about just how jaw-droppingly awesome the upcoming film <a href="http://wip.warnerbros.com/ascannerdarkly/"><cite>A Scanner Darkly</cite></a> looks.</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="Keanu Reeves in A Scanner Darkly" id="image79" title="Keanu Reeves in A Scanner Darkly" src="http://old.kevinyank.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/scannerdarkly.jpg" />Yes, it's got Keanu Reeves in it. I still haven't forgiven him for his role in <cite>Constantine</cite> (which could have been a brilliant adaptation of <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/features/hellblazer/">one of my favourite comic series</a> if not for the unstoppable Hollywood mediocrity machine), but his acting style does seem to suit the brain-damaged character it seems he will portray in this film.</p>
<p>From the makers of <cite>Waking Life</cite>, <cite>A Scanner Darkly</cite> features the same 2D computer animation process as that film, except it looks like both the technology and the artists have raised their game in this one. The heightened portrayal of real-world people and places that results is both incredibly detailed and satisfyingly stylized. The artwork is also distinctly more illustrative and realistic than the often painterly looks of <cite>Waking Life</cite>.</p>
<p>And if the eye candy weren't enough, the story of <cite>A Scanner Darkly</cite> is adapted from the Philip K. Dick novel of the same name. That's the kind of material that's hard to mess up.</p>
