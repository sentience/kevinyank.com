In [Subspace Radio #24](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-24-swearing-in-star-trek-pic-3x04-no-win-scenario), Rob and I are both dazzled by what may be the best episode of modern Star Trek, "No Win Scenario", and shocked by the return of 21st century expletives to the Star Trek universe. After gushing over every other aspect of this week's episode, they share their very personal perspectives and reactions to swearing in Star Trek, and reflect on its history. Highlights of the trip include "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", "City on the Edge of Forever" (TOS), "The Last Outpost" and "Elementary, Dear Data" (TNG), and "Star Trek: Generations".
