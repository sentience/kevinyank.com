  content: "Oh! Sunny is so sweet!! I want a cuddle! memories of childhood guinea
    pigs are flooding back in a rush. My favourite was a flaming orange abyssinian
    named Cassanova that our next-door neighbour found in his cabbage patch. \n\nCassanova
    lived for many years he was the best.\n\nOver the years I kept many guinea pigs
    but finally gave them up in the quest for a pet dog!\n\nGeeks with guinea pigs...
    could be a new movement."

The bump is mysterious, but we expect him to be fine.</p>
<p>At home with Jess, Toffee seems lost without his big brother. The pair haven't been apart for more than an hour in their entire lives!</p>
<p><ins><strong>Update:</strong> Sunny's home and doing fine. He'll have a cool scar to show the ladies.</ins></p>
