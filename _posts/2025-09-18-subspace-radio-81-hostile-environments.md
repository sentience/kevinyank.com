In [Subspace Radio #81](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-81-hostile-environments-snw-3x09-terrarium), Rob and I argue over who will cook the worm we found in a hole on the other side of a wormhole, then huddle by the light of a camp stove to discuss "Terrarium" (SNW). While we await our rescue-slash-murder, we compare notes on other instances of crashed enemies finding common ground in "Darmok" (TNG) and "Dawn" (ENT).
