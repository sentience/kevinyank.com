I’ve missed producing video training since I left [Learnable][l] in 2012, and published my _[Up and Running with Sublime Text 2][lyndasublime]_ course in 2013. To scratch this itch, I’ve just launched **[Screencast a Week][saw]**, a series of short, weekly videos that show off power user tips and tricks for the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and whatever else I come up with.

To support this project, [I’m asking for help on Patreon][sawpatreon], a site that lets you pledge a small amount of money for each video that I publish. In return, you get early access to new episodes, high-quality video downloads, and more!

Over the years, I’ve gotten used to answering questions like “What’s that app in your menu bar?”, and hearing people say “Hey, I didn’t know you could do that!” while watching me use my Mac. I’ve always thought it’d be fun to share some of my best tips in video form, so that’s what Screencast a Week is all about.

The first episode, which shows how to access hard-to-find menu items in OS X applications with the keyboard, is already available to supporters, and I'll release it for free on Sunday, March 29th. At the same time, episode two will go live for supporters.

If you enjoy the show, I hope you’ll consider helping me out by pledging a dollar or two per episode!
