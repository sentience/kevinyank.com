In [Subspace Radio #27](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-27-taken-over-pic-3x07-dominion), Rob and I are getting some distinctly cybernetic vibes about Crusher & Picard's son Jack as they contemplate Section 31's worst plan yet in "Dominion". Vadic's commandeering of the Titan prompts them to revisit other times our Starfleet heroes lost control of their ships (and space stations) to the opposition, in "Star Trek: First Contact", "Rascals" (TNG), "Call to Arms" (DS9), and "Basics, Part I & II" (VOY).
