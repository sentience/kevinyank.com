excerpt: In preparation for an upcoming long-haul flight today, I rented a couple
  of HD movies in iTunes on my Mac, and attempted to transfer them to my iPad (3rd
  generation). At first it seemed like an annoying error would prevent me from doing
  this, but I found a work-around and thought it was worth sharing.

  content: I'm in Canada and have had the exact same problem. I spoke with Apple support.
    They had me delete my iTunes database and start from scratch. I thought it fixed
    my issue, but it only masked the issue. I have the same thing as you where I can
    delete the track in iTunes, re-import it to iTunes and it plays fine.If you find
    any longer term fix, please let me know. I'll do the same. ..Thanks.

    movies on my iPad. Much appreciation.

  content: "Great work-around.  How did you discover this?\r\n\r\nI was afraid I'd
    have to go talk to a \"genius\" who would then have me put my iPad into DFU (de-f*ck-up?)
    mode and do a \"full\" restore (which, of course, is anything but \"full\" --
    and anything but \"fast\" -- requiring all my Zinio magazines, Audible audiobooks,
    Kindle books, etc, to be re-downloaded), only to discover that my purchased iTunes
    videos still wouldn't sync.\r\n\r\niTunes purchases and rentals are supposed to
    make the process so painless that people will stop pirating stuff.  With these
    kinds of non-sensical and unhelpful errors, Apple is shooting themselves in the
    foot."

  content: I have always been watching how I met your mother on my iPad with no problem.
    I've reached season 8 and all the files are mp4 (PC user) and they are all in
    iTunes, although when I sync them only 4 of them are going onto the iPad because
    the other ones are not supported formats from the iPad. I tried your technique,
    and it still isn't working. Please help!!!!

<p>For the past several months, I’ve had an ongoing issue with iTunes, where TV shows that I purchase from iTunes download, but then are unplayable with the error “This movie requires QuickTime, which is not supported by this version of iTunes.” Emails to iTunes support have not yielded any response, but I’ve found a work-around, which is to delete the episode from iTunes, tell iTunes to keep the file, and then add the file back into my iTunes library, after which it is playable.</p>
<p><img src="http://old.kevinyank.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/requires_quicktime.png" alt="screenshot of the error: “This film requires QuickTime, which is not supported by this version of iTunes.”" border="0" width="600" height="276" /><a id="more"></a><a id="more-240"></a>In preparation for an upcoming long-haul flight today, I rented a couple of HD movies in iTunes on my Mac, and attempted to transfer them to my iPad (3rd generation). In case you didn’t know, you can do this on the Movies tab (it’s labeled Films in the UK English locale) for a connected iPad in iTunes:</p>
<p><img src="http://old.kevinyank.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/itunes_transfer_movies.png" alt="iTunes interface for transferring rented movies" border="0" width="600" height="183" /></p>
<p>At first, it seemed as if the format of HD movie rentals from iTunes was incompatible with the new iPad. The error I was getting was “the video format is not supported by the iPad”, although when the iPad sync only caused a single error, I got a different message: “it cannot be played on this iPad.”</p>
<p><img src="http://old.kevinyank.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tinkertailorerror.png" alt="screenshot of the error message: “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” was not copied to the iPad “Kevin Yank’s iPad” because it cannot be played on this iPad." border="0" width="595" height="320" /></p>
<p>A few Google searches suggested that, indeed, iTunes HD movie rentals (even the fancy new 1080p ones) should play just fine on the new iPad. After all, it has more pixels than the 1080p TV you probably have in your living room!</p>
<p>After spending a few minutes thinking what a bother it would be to watch these movies in my plane seat on my 15" MacBook Pro (first world problem, anyone?), I noticed that none of my movie rentals were showing artwork in iTunes, and I remembered the persistent issue I have with TV shows downloaded from the iTunes Store. Could something similar be happening here? I couldn’t check by trying to play the movies, because doing so would kick off my 24-hour rental period (48 hours if you rent from a non-US iTunes store), which I wasn’t ready to do, but I <em>could</em> try my work-around, right?</p>
<p>Deleting the movies from iTunes and re-adding them was going to be tricky, because when you delete a rented movie in iTunes, it doesn’t offer you the option to keep the file. It just deletes it. The trick is to locate the file in Finder (go into the Rentals list in iTunes, right-click on the rental and choose Show in Finder), use Get Info to open the inspector, and check the Locked checkbox to make the file read-only.</p>
<p><img src="http://old.kevinyank.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tinkerlocked.png" alt="screenshot: the Locked checkbox is check" border="0" width="446" height="462" /></p>
<p>Now I could delete the file safely in iTunes, then drag it back in to iTunes to add it back into my library. If you use this trick, don’t forget to unlock the file afterward, or it will end up stuck on your hard disk taking up space. The movies now had artwork, and would transfer to your iPad without complaint.</p>

<p>I’m ready for my flight! :)</p>
