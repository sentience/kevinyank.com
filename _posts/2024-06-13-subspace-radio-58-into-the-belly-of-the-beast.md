In [Subspace Radio #58](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-58-into-the-belly-of-the-beast-dis-5x09-lagrange-point), Rob and I are inspired by "Lagrange Point" to don our Breen helmets and travel into dangerous waters with Starfleet crews who have done the same over the years. We discuss "The Immunity Syndrome" (TOS), "Apocalypse Rising" (DS9) and "Unimatrix Zero" (VOY).
