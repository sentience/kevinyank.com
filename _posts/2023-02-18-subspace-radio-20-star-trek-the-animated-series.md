In [Subspace Radio #20](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-20-star-trek-the-animated-series), Rob and I pass the time before Star Trek: Picard season three by doing a full watch-through of Star Trek: The Animated Series for the first time. We discuss the creation of this historical curiosity, run down all twenty-two episodes picking our best and worst, and then finally grapple with the ultimate question: is it worth watching The Animated Series today?
