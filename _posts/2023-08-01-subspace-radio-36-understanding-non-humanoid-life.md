In [Subspace Radio #36](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-36-understanding-non-humanoid-life-snw-2x06-lost-in-translation), Rob and I squint but fail to spot the USS Farragut in "Lost in Translation", despite its soon-to-be first officer hanging around the Enterprise like he knows he's going to work there someday! After a quick debrief on this week's episode, they consider two other prominent instances of communication difficulties when encountering non-humanoid life: "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", and "Home Soil" (TNG).
