In [Subspace Radio #84](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-84-future-sports-sa-1x03-vitus-reflux), Rob and I steal each other's deltas and end up as mascots on opposing Calica teams. At halftime, we discuss "Vitus Reflux" (SA), before being transported into the shallow pond of other futuristic sports seen throughout Star Trek history: Anbo-jyutsu (TNG), Springball (DS9), Parrises Squares (TNG, VOY, PRO), and Velocity (VOY).
