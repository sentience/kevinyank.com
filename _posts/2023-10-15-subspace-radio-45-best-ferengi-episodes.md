In [Subspace Radio #45](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-45-best-ferengi-episodes-ld-4x06-parth-ferengis-heart-place), Rob and I back up our truck of gold pressed latinum to Uncle Quark's Youth Casino in "Parth Ferengi's Heart Place", then stay for the haggling at the Museum of Gambling (and the gambling at the Museum of Haggling), and compare our picks for the best Ferengi-centric episode, "Ménage à Troi" (TNG) and "The Magnificent Ferengi" (DS9). Also stick around at the end for our thoughts on the recently-completed run of Very Short Treks!
