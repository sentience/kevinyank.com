In [Subspace Radio #25](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-25-ro-laren-michelle-forbes-pic-3x05-imposters), Rob & I come from opposite ends of the spectrum of Ro Laren familiarity, but we both loved Michelle Forbes's return to Star Trek in "Imposters". Rob introduces Kevin to some of Forbes's other roles in "Homicide: Life on the Street" and "True Blood", then Kevin talks through the highlights of Ro's appearances in Star Trek: The Next Generation, including "Ensign Ro", "Preemptive Strike", and "The Next Phase".
