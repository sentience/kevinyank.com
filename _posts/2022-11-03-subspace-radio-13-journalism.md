In [Subspace Radio #13](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-13-journalism-ld-3x09-trusted-sources), Rob & Kev doggedly investigate what Star Trek: Lower Decks season 3, episode 9 ["Trusted Sources"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Trusted_Sources_(episode)) teaches us about journalism in the Star Trek universe. They also revisit other prominent appearances of journalists in the final frontier, including Jake Sisko and the gaggle of reporters at the launch of the USS Enterprise B in [Star Trek: Generations](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Generations).
