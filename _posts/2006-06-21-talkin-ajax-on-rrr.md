<p>I'll be appearing on <a href="http://www.rrr.org.au/">RRR</a>'s <a href="http://www.rrr.org.au/onair.php?pid=24"><cite>Byte Into It</cite></a> tonight (102.7FM in Melbourne) between 7PM and 8PM to talk about <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</acronym> and plug SitePoint's latest book, <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/ajax1/"><cite>Build Your Own AJAX Web Applications</cite></a>. There is a <a href="http://www.rrr.org.au/archive/byte/bytepod.xml">podcast feed</a> for the show, or you can just download the episode from <a href="http://www.rrr.org.au/onair.php?pid=24">the archive</a> if you prefer. I'll mirror it here once it goes live.</p>
