In [Subspace Radio #12](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-12-not-actually-dead-ld-3x07-crisis-point-2-paradoxus), Kev & Rob are divided on the return to the holodeck that was Star Trek: Lower Decks season 3, episode 8, ["Crisis Point 2: Paradoxus"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Crisis_Point_2:_Paradoxus_(episode)), but they're both pretty sure that the "resurrection" of Boimler's transporter clone William won't live up to the legacy of Spock's return in [Star Trek III](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_III:_The_Search_for_Spock).
