  you may not know it, a handy feature of most modern \"freezer-on-top\" refrigerators
  (unless you have one of those Internet fridges, in which case you have bigger problems,
  my friend) is that you can move the hinges from one side of the appliance to the

    <blockquote>a perceived near-dedigitation</blockquote>

    I would like to congratulate you on your use of the term "dedigitation" :) How did you manage to nearly lop off a finger with a fridge?

<p>No, this isn't some kind of rant against EM radiation from home appliances or garishly promotional food packaging. We have simply reconfigured our fridge door from right-hand opening to left-hand opening, and I swear it's giving me brain tumours!</p>

<p>Given the layout of our kitchen, this is a perfectly logical change to make. But boy are those two pages of simplistic-looking instructions in the refrigerator manual misleading. (Yes, I read manuals.)</p>
<p>An hour and two litres of melted ice cream later, the door hinges had been moved, Jess had been traumatised by a perceived near-dedigitation, and neither of us could open the fridge in one try.</p>
<p>I expect it'll take us a couple of weeks to reprogram our brains to the new door-opening direction. In the meantime, I've stuck a large "PULL" sign on the appropriate corner of the door. It hasn't helped at all.</p>
