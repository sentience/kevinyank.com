In [Subspace Radio #51](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-51-starships-bumping-into-planets-dis-5x01-red-directive-dis-5x02-under-the-twin-moons), are back to finally, unbelievably, talk about Star Trek: Discovery for the very first time! The events of "Red Directive" (DIS) see us reflecting on other times starships have "nosed down" into the unforgiving soil of a world, alien or otherwise. We discuss "Star Trek Into Darkness", "Timeless" (VOY), and "Star Trek Generations".
