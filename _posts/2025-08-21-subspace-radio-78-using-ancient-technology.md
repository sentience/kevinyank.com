In [Subspace Radio #78](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-78-using-ancient-technology-snw-3x06-the-sehlat-who-ate-its-tail), Rob and I record our entire conversation about "The Sehlat Who Ate Its Tail" (SNW) over copper wires with pink telephone receivers. We then visit two previous uses of "ancient" technology in Trek adventures, "Spectre of the Gun" (TOS) and "Vis Ã  Vis" (VOY).
