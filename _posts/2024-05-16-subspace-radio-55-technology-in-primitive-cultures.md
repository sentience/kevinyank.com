In [Subspace Radio #55](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-55-technology-in-primitive-cultures-dis-5x06-whistlespeak), we whistle our way through the "fun run" on Halemâ€™no as we discuss "Whistlespeak", but are wise enough not to step into the rain-making machine at the finish line. Instead, we revisit past instances of primitive cultures unknowingly blended with advanced technology, including "The Apple" (TOS), "For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky" (TOS), and "Caretaker" (VOY).
