In [Subspace Radio #61](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-61-too-good-to-be-true-planets-pro-2x06-10), Rob and I learn that there's no such thing as paradise in Star Trek â€“ no matter how many scantily clad natives you throw into the mix. After a brief discussion of Star Trek: Prodigy season two episodes six through ten, we discuss "This Side of Paradise" (TOS), "Paradise" (DS9), "Justice" (TNG), and "Lift Us Where Suffering Cannot Reach" (SNW).
