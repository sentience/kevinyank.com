In [Subspace Radio #29](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-29-dna-shenanigans-pic-3x09-vox), Rob and I sequence the genome of "Võx", the penultimate episode of Star Trek: Picard. Then, agreeing the Changleing plot to re-sequence the DNA of every member of Starfleet was a lot to take in, set out to trace the twin helix of DNA as a plot point in Star Trek. They discuss "Genesis" (TNG), the Jem'Hadar (DS9), "Threshold" (VOY), and "Vaulting Ambition" (DIS).
