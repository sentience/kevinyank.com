In [Subspace Radio #42](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-42-lessons-in-leadership-ld-4x03-in-the-cradle-of-vexilon), Rob and I planned to turn this entire episode over to a friendly computer super-intelligence, but it was down for a software update, so we recorded our thoughts on "In the Cradle of Vexilon" all by ourselves. Prompted by the hard lesson learned by Boimler during his first command, we explored other lessons in leadership from Star Treks past, including "The Galileo Seven" (TOS), "Good Shepherd" (VOY), "Pen Pals" (TNG), and "Valiant" (DS9).
