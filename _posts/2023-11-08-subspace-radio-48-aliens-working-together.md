In [Subspace Radio #48](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-48-aliens-working-together-ld-4x09-the-inner-fight), Rob and I fend off our inner demons, take shelter from a patch of knife rain, and watch "The Inner Fight", the penultimate episode of season four of Star Trek: Lower Decks. Inspired by Mariner's ability to unite the clashing aliens trapped on Sherbal V, we discuss other conspicuous occasions of multi-species alliances in Star Trek, including "The Time Trap" (TAS), the Dominion War (DS9), "The Enemy" (TNG), "Allegiance" (TNG), and the production design of sets and locations like the Promenade (DS9).
