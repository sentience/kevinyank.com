In [Subspace Radio #70](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-70-unseen-crews-ld-5x08-upper-decks), Rob and I leap from universe to universe in search of wacky versions of people from history to crew our swanky starship in "Fissure Quest". We then revisit two characters brought into the spotlight for arguably their strongest outings in this episode. For Harry Kim we discuss "Non Sequitur" (VOY) and "Nightingale" (VOY). For T'Pol we discuss "Stigma" (ENT) and "Home" (ENT).
