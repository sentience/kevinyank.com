    ensemble, this was the first Festival where I took to the stage! Joining on opening
    night the cast of Impro Melbourne&#8217;s production of Smells Like a Song was

<p><img align="right" alt="Impro Melbourne logo" id="image124" title="Impro Melbourne logo" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/Logo_black_03.gif" />At long last my campaign of bribery, veiled threats, and out-and-out blackmail has paid off. I have been asked to join the core performance ensemble of <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/">Impro Melbourne</a>.</p>
<p>Seriously though, this is the culmination of three years of training and practice on my part, and of mentorship and support on the company's. I've come a long way since the days where I'd sit in the audience and think, "I could never do that." Along the way, I've had the privilege to play with those I had idolised, to learn by their influence and example, and to stand on their shoulders while developing my own approach and style. Today, I was asked to join their number, an overwhelming honour.</p>
<p>For those of you who have come to see me in Impro Melbourne shows in the past, I'll now be performing in later segments of those same shows, along with the other permanent members of the company. As I settle in and find my footing, I'm likely to appear in more shows and in more prominent roles than I have in the past.</p>
<p>In some ways, this transition is bittersweet. I've trained, created and laughed with members of Impro Melbourne's "junior" level (internally called the Technique/Craft group, for want of a better name) for two years now, most recently creating the original format, <a href="/blog/archives/tangents/">Tangents</a>, of which I am <a href="/blog/archives/post-tangential/">immensely proud</a>. Although I look forward to continuing to share the stage with them, I won't be training with them on a regular basis anymore. I'll miss those Tuesday night classes, and do hope to be involved with the rumoured revival and restaging of Tangents next year. But most of all I look forward to their joining me in the ensemble one day soon—something will be missing until they do.</p>
<p>As with most endings, this is in many ways just the beginning of a new and more challenging path. I still have many things to learn, bad habits and preconceptions to shed, and private discoveries to make. The difference is that from today, I'll be doing it alongside the other members of Impro Melbourne, and I couldn't hope for better company.</p>
