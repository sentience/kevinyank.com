In [Subspace Radio #22](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-22-scenery-chewing-villains-pic-3x03-disengage), Rob and I are only momentarily distracted by the parentage of one Jack Crusher before latching onto Amanda Plummer's performance as Vadic in Star Trek: Picard season three, episode two, "Disengage". We then count down our favourite scenery-chewing villains from Star Trek canon, including Weyoun (DS9), General Chang (ST6), Khan (ST2), and Evil Kirk (TOS: The Enemy Within).
