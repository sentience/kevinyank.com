  content: I want to get a Mac ASAP though it's not likely before January 2008. However
    without an Mac equivalent of Excel, I'll reluctantly have to get MS Office installed
    early on. But at least I know how to use Office. :)

<p>I bought my first Mac yesterdayâ€”a spiffy, black MacBook. I've spent the first 24 hours with my new computer setting up various means of running Windows on it (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=remotedesktopclient">Remote Desktop</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a>, and <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/">Parallels</a>). In the Mac world, I'm pretty sure that makes me very lame.</p>
