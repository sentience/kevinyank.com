In [Subspace Radio #59](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-59-hand-to-hand-combat-dis-5x10-life-itself), Rob and I take stock of Star Trek: Discovery following its finale, "Life, Itself." Burnham's epic fistfight with Moll prompts us to revisit other Trek punch-ups of the past, including "The Way of the Warrior, Part II" (DS9), "The Gamesters of Triskelion" (TOS), "Tsunkatse" (VOY), "Star Trek" (2009), and "Trials and Tribble-ations".
