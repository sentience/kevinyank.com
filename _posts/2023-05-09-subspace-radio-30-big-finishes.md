In [Subspace Radio #30](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-30-big-finishes-pic-3x10-the-last-generation), much like "The Last Generation", this Subspace Radio had about 40 minutes of footage cut out of it, and it's *still* a double-length episode! Rob & I comb through every morsel of the series finale of Star Trek: Picard, before turning back the clock to other finale episodes of series past, including "All Good Things…" (TNG), "What You Leave Behind" (DS9), "Endgame" (VOY) and "These Are the Voyages…" (ENT).
