In [Subspace Radio #35](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-35-vulcans-are-jerks-snw-2x05-charades), Rob and I gush at the one-two punch of comedy and heartbreak delivered by "Charades" before breaking down the several different ways in which Vulcans are such jerks, revisiting "The Forge", "Awakening" and "Kir'Shara" (ENT), "Take Me Out to the Holosuite" (DS9), and "Journey to Babel" (TOS).
