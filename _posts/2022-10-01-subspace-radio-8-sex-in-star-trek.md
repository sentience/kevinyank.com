In [Subspace Radio #8](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-8-sex-in-star-trek-ld-3x04-room-for-growth), Rob & Kev embark on a perilous voyage in search of positive depictions of sex in Star Trek. Propelled by Star Trek: Lower Decks season 3, episode 4, ["Room for Growth"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Room_for_Growth_(episode)), they explore Captain Kirk putting on his boots in ["Wink of an Eye"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Wink_of_an_Eye_(episode)), Data's twisting (and twisted!) journey of sexual self-discovery in ["The Naked Now"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Naked_Now_(episode)), and Captain Janeway using the holodeck for what it does best in ["Fair Haven"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Fair_Haven_(episode)).
