<p><a href="http://webdirections.org/">Web Directions South</a> has just wrapped in Sydney, but while I wait for the shower in our hotel room to be free I figured I should record a few rapidly fading memories.</p>
<p>Having attended last year's Web Essentials 05 as a vicarious observer, getting to contribute to the conversation this year as a speaker alongside the inimitable <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/">Cameron Adams</a> was a huge treat.</p>
<p><a href="https://flickr.com/photos/lucasmoblog/255279578/"><img align="right" src="https://static.flickr.com/90/255279578_9ef9483846_m.jpg" /></a>Despite a flaky Internet connection, our talk, <cite>JavaScript APIs & Mashups: Work You Don't Have To Do</cite>, brought the house down thanks to a few generous helpings of serendipity and the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lucasmoblog/255285797/">nimble photography</a> of one <a href="http://lucaschan.com/">Lucas Chan</a> that led to a photo taken early in our talk making a cameo appearance onscreen moments later.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I managed to distance myself from the <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/lucasmoblog/254503317/">topless rivalry</a> between Cameron and <a href="http://domscripting.com/author/">Jeremy Keith</a> this year, but I may have to revise some of the privacy settings on my Flickr account if I'm invited back next year (not that lack of evidence was a deterrent for the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lucasmoblog/255285797/">resourceful Cam</a>).</p>
<p>My deep and sincere apologies to the family and friends of the moth that I killed during the presentation. If it's any consolation, I suspect I will be living down the phrase "Ooh, a moth!" for several years to come.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="http://www.solidariti.com/">Priscilla</a>, for being such a good sport when I dragged you up on stage to test your humanity with <a href="http://www.hotcaptcha.com/">HotCaptcha</a>. Take pride in having failed!</p>
<p>Amazing people aplenty at the conference, and it was a privilege to get to exchange thoughts and banter with so many of them: <a href="http://molly.com/">Molly</a>, <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy</a>, <a href="http://boxofchocolates.ca/">Derek</a>, <a href="http://domscripting.com/author/">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://www.brothercake.com/">James</a>, <a href="http://webstandardsgroup.org/features/gian-sampson-wild.cfm">Gian</a>, <a href="http://silkcharm.blogspot.com/">Laurel</a>, <a href="http://www.vanderwal.net/">Thomas</a>, and the many readers of <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/">SitePoint</a> (new and old) at the closing night party (yes, even those that were just after free drink cards)... I am truly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>It's 3.15am. I catch a flight to Spain with Molly and Andy in exactly twelve hours, and I still have a newsletter to write. Perhaps I'll skip the shower and get straight to bed.</p>
