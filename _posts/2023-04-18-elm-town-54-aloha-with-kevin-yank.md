I'm delighted to see [the Elm Town podcast](https://elmtown.simplecast.com) return to an active state thanks to new host [Jared M. Smith](https://jaredmsmith.com), who reached out to me a few months ago to ask if I was open to handing over the keys to the city â€¦ or town, as it were.

This farewell interview with yours truly covers the same ground as my recent post, [On Endings](2023-04-05-on-endings-why-how-we-retired-elm-at-culture-amp.md), but with Jared asking questions to probe deeper in certain spots.

I loved being the host of Elm Town, but it's good to see the show back in the hands of someone actively working in the language day-to-day. I'll be listening!
