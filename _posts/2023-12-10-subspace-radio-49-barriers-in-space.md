In [Subspace Radio #49](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-49-barriers-in-space-ld-4x10-old-friends-new-planets), Rob and I approach the infinitely wide, unfathomably tall, impenetrable barrier that is the end of Star Trek: Lower Decks, Season Four, "Old Friends, New Planets". Among the many tangents we explore this episode, we focus in on other barriers in space, including "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (TOS), "The Tholian Web" (TOS), "Encounter at Farpoint" (TNG), and "The Galactic Barrier" (DIS). Stay after the credits for a brief debrief on "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier".
