In [Subspace Radio #75](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-75-horror-snw-3x03-shuttle-to-kenfori), Rob and I creep through a suspiciously silent science lab to discuss "Shuttle to Kenfori" (SNW), and agree that it wasn't the scariest episode of Star Trek ever. After all, there was "Conspiracy" (TNG) and "Empok Nor" (DS9). To shake off the scares, we take a few minutes to discuss Jim Henson's Creature Shop coming to a starship bridge near you.
