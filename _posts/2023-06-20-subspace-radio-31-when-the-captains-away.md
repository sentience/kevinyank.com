In [Subspace Radio #31](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-31-when-the-captains-away-snw-2x01-the-broken-circle), Rob and I celebrate the return of Strange New Worlds by punching a corridor full of Klingons before sitting down to share our thoughts about "The Broken Circle", and other notable examples of crews operating without their Captain (or station Commander, as the case may be!) in "The Tholian Web" (TOS), "Family Business" (DS9), "Little Green Men" (DS9), "Two Days and Two Nights" (ENT), and "The Quickening" (DS9).
