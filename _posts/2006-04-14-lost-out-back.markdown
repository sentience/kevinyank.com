<p>Check out my podcast! It's called <a href="http://www.lostoutback.com/">Lost Out Back</a>, and my friend John and I have been working on "lost episodes" for a couple of months. It's not perfect, but it's fun. I hope you think so too!</p>
<blockquote><p>A podcast about Australia by two unlikely candidates: a geek from the Great White North and a lad from the Emerald Isle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Episode two was put up just this week. I think it's way funnier than episode one.</p>
<p>A feed is available if you're tech-savvy; if not, I'll put up an email notification option soon so you can catch every episode as it comes out.</p>
