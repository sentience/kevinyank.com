excerpt: "Like a good nerd, I spent my Saturday installing the latest <a href=\"http://microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/\">pre-release
  operating system</a> on my computer. Having bought a 64-bit processor several years
  ago, now, I figured it was about time to try running a 64-bit operating system on
  it, so I downloaded the 64-bit version of Windows Vista Beta 2.\r\n\r\n"

  content: You should give Ubuntu Linux's 64 bit version a go... it'll dual boot and
    only needs about 10 gigs for a base system (without media like MP3s or Video but
    LOTS OF SOFTWARE) It made my old 600 MHz system run like it was a 2 GHz....

  content: If you think the 32-bit version is gonna let you use your wireless adapter
    you are sadly mistaken. I have the same adapter with the 32-bit version and it
    doesn't work either. I contacted linksys and they told me they have no Win Vista
    drivers and therefore their products wont work on Win Vista. They assured me that
    they will be releasing drivers after it becomes full blown Win Vista and not just
    Beta stages.

  content: Chaos, I was able to get the adapter working with the 32-bit version. Linksys's
    Wireless Network Monitor software didn't work, but the driver loaded successfully
    and I was able to use Vista's built-in wireless networking tools to configure
    it.

    Um, well yeah Microsoft can't write drivers for every piece of hardware.

    And why do you fail to mention the chip on the card ?  Most retail package drivers are just to demonstrate the product working, and then the card manufacturer never again bothers with releasing updated drivers provided from the chipset manufacturer.

    So go to the chipset manufacturer - that will be more likely.

    But it Seems  microsoft is making a mistake. XP, Xp 64 bit, 2003 server,  2003 server 64 bit, vista and vista 64 bit all require different drivers ???

    I dont get that. Why can't they all use Windows XP drivers , even with the  poor performance of double buffering, that would help many people use the new OS's ...

    Leon,

    Vista 32-bit, generally speaking, can use Windows XP 32-bit drivers, and Vista 64-bit can use Windows XP 64-bit drivers.

    As far as going to the chipset manufacturer for drivers, that's exactly what I mentioned trying above.

  content: "I loaded Vista on my HP Athlon XP laptop.....runs like a dog..but the
    Linksys WPC54G card works with the Vista default 'Broadcom' chipset client..but
    only on a wireless network with no WEP. Mine uses WEP and for some reason...WEP
    doesn't work.\r\n\r\nNot tried WPA etc but Vista   Linksys   WEP is no go. The
    Linksys card does work though using native drivers from Vista."

  content: For my WMP54G the chipset is provided by Railink and they have 64 bit drivers
    of the chipset rt2500.  Works like a charm in Windows Vista 64 bit.

    driver for Windows XP x64 and I'm wondering would that work? Going to try it when
    I get a chance.

  content: "Well, Vista's been released and Linksys still isn't showing any Vista
    32-bit drivers available for download for the WMP54G.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting
    is that I can upgrade my existing WinXP installation and Vista picks up the drivers
    and works just fine. But if I do a clean install, and try to use the same drivers,
    no luck."

  content: I was able to get my Linksys wireless adapter to work in Vista. First I
    installed Windows XP and got the Linksys to work using the XP drivers. Then I
    did a Vista update install and it retained the ability to use the Linksys wireless
    adapter.

<p>Like a good nerd, I spent my Saturday installing the latest <a href="http://microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/">pre-release operating system</a> on my computer. Having bought a 64-bit processor several years ago, now, I figured it was about time to try running a 64-bit operating system on it, so I downloaded the 64-bit version of Windows Vista Beta 2.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-88"></a>The insallation went reasonably well. I had to switch over to using the VIA hard disk controller on my motherboard because the Promise controller does not have 64-bit drivers available, but once that was out of the way the installation completed without complaint. Unfortunately, this would mean I couldn't have more than my two SATA hard drives on my system, but I could live with that limitation for now.</p>
<p>What I <em>couldn't</em> live with, however, was an absence of wireless networking. My Linksys WMP54G, surely one of the most common wireless network adapters for desktop computers, has no 64-bit drivers available (Linksys support contritely confirmed this, and assured me that work was underway). An <a href="http://files.aoaforums.com/I2130-RT2500V3.0.1.0_for_Win2003.zip.html">alternative driver</a> produced by the chipset manufacturer, which <a href="http://bob-obringer.com/A557B7/blog.nsf/dx/06192005235957DOM7VJ.htm">reputedly works</a> with Windows XP 64-bit, installed but failed to do anything on Vista Beta 2.</p>
<p>I'm downloading the 32-bit edition of Vista Beta 2 now. Somehow it just doesn't feel as geeky.</p>
