  /></a>After the hectic week-and-a-half that has been <a href=\"/blog/archives/impro-a-go-go\">Unforeseen
  Stories</a>, I'm enjoying a quiet evening to myself on the grounds of the <a href=\"http://www.abbotsfordconvent.com.au/\">Abbotsford
  Convent</a>, where <a href=\"http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/\">Impro Melbourne</a>
  keeps its offices and holds most of its training sessions.\r\n\r\nTonight, Jess
  is training along with the rest of the company's \"Technique\" group of up-and-comers
  in preparation for putting on <a href=\"http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/shows/cave2007\">a
  season of Harold beginning in July</a>. Meanwhile, I've visited a couple of nearby
  geocaches following reports of a <a title=\"Norwegian Postcard coin\" href=\"http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?tracker=TB1B40C\">geocoin</a>
  in the area and have now settled down in a quiet courtyard to partake of the peace
  and serenity (not to mention the Impro Melbourne wireless network).\r\n\r\n"

  content: Fancy this, I was looking for a Geocaching Plugin for Wordpress and came
    up with this post of yours Kev! I am in Melbourne for a short stay with family
    and quickly going back for a busy season of guests and building at the Inn. Next
    time I must plan better and try and catch up.

<p>Tonight, Jess is training along with the rest of the company's "Technique" group of up-and-comers in preparation for putting on <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/shows/cave2007">a season of Harold beginning in July</a>. Meanwhile, I've visited a couple of nearby geocaches following reports of a <a title="Norwegian Postcard coin" href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?tracker=TB1B40C">geocoin</a> in the area and have now settled down in a quiet courtyard to partake of the peace and serenity (not to mention the Impro Melbourne wireless network).</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-156"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_(improvisation)">Harold</a>—at least the way <em>we</em> play it, which is more formally known as the Unstructured Harold—is a free-form improvisation format where players riff on a particular word or theme through a series of scenes, movement pieces, musical numbers and whatever else happens to come about. These are revisited (or not) until the whole thing culminates into a (hopefully) satisfying conclusion. Sarah Kinsella, Impro Melbourne's foremost authority on Harold, directed the format during Unforeseen Stories, and is leading the training of the Technique group for their July run.</p>
<p>Because Harold is almost entirely different every time it is played, it's one of those formats you can fall in love with after seeing a particular show, and then get frustrated with as you attempt to recapture that magic. On the other hand, Harold also tends to produce a new and different kind of magic every time it is played ... which is what keeps me coming back for more.</p>
