In [Subspace Radio #32](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-32-courtroom-dramas-snw-2x02-ad-astra-per-aspera), Rob and I agree to overrule all objections about the trial of Una Chin-Riley in "Ad Astra per Aspera". We then explore the legal precedents for excellent courtroom dramas in Star Trek, including "Judgment" (ENT), "Court Martial" (TOS), "Dax" (DS9), and "The Measure of a Man" (TNG). Finally, we commiserate following the shock announcement that Star Trek: Prodigy has been cancelled prior to the airing of season two on Paramount+ and Nickelodeon.
