  content: "Hey Kev,\r\n\r\nGood work with the Impro!  Keep it up!  \r\n\r\nI'm afraid
    I've gone a little cold turkey since the heady days of Melbourne and Foundation
    2/3, but I'm sure that drive and gameshow host demeanour of yours will take you
    far!\r\n\r\nWish I could see you on stage with the big guns!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRob."

<p>This Saturday, May 13th, I'm performing in <cite>Heaven or Hell</cite>, part of <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/">Impro Melbourne</a>'s <a href="http://www.impromelbourne.com.au/Feature.php?page=Shows&Category=All&ContentID=90"><cite>Unforeseen Stories</cite></a>, a series of long-form improvised theatre performances. <cite>Heaven or Hell</cite> was developed and performed at last year's <a href="http://comedyfestival.com.au/">Comedy Festival</a>, so it promises to be a funny show.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-77"></a>I've trained and performed with Impro Melbourne for over two years now, but this is the first show I've been invited to play in alongside the amazingly talented members of the company's core ensemble. A little nerve-wracking, but mostly it's a huge honour!</p>
<p>So if you happen to be in Melbourne and are looking for a unique and hilarious way to spend your Saturday night, come down to St. Kilda and watch me sink or swim!</p>
<p>The show will be directed by the talented Patti Stiles, and the cast will include <span class="postbody">Rik Brown, </span><span class="postbody">Mark Gambino, </span><span class="postbody">Gina Kennedy, </span><span class="postbody">Jenny Lovell, Karl McConnell and yours truly.</span></p>
<p>Details:<br />
Theatreworks<br />
14 Acland Street, St. Kilda<br />
Saturday, May 13th at 8pm<br />
$12 at the door</p>
