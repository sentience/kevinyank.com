<p><a rel="attachment" id="p32" href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/"><img align="right" alt="CBC Radio 3 Logo" id="image32" title="CBC Radio 3 Logo" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/r3_logo.gif" /></a>Listening to the excellent <a href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/">CBC Radio 3 podcast</a> while at work these days. Aside from the occasional offensive hip-hop track (<em>really</em> not my thing), I'm loving most of the stuff they play.</p>
<p>The podcast makes great listening while driving too, but for the continual frustration of not being able to stop and note down the artists I want to check out later. Re-listening to the episodes at work is allowing me to do just that.</p>
<p>First on my list to check out is <a href="http://www.christinefellows.com/">Christine Fellows</a>, whose track <cite>Vertebrae</cite> really tugs at my insides.</p>
