    Hey,

    I've never actually heard of the game but I was totally into Secret City when I was about 12.  I had 10 episodes on tape but they were taped over.  I wonder if you can get the old ones anywhere.  I spent a hell of a lot of time drawing cities and spaceships because of that show.  That mural was awesome!
    Thanks for the memories.

<p><img align="right" title="Rolling Madness Screenshot" id="image50" alt="Rolling Madness Screenshot" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/mmadness.png" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness"><cite>Marble Madness</cite></a> is a game that has been on my mind a lot over the years, considering I have never actually played it.</p>
<p>Though it was first released in 1984 and was ported to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_family">Apple IIe</a> (my first computer) two years later, I first saw the game when it came to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES) in 1989. I've been wanting to play it ever since. A just-released free remake called <a href="http://www.lucaelia.com/games.php"><cite>Rolling Madness</cite></a> might allow me to do just that... if I ever get it working.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-51"></a>I think what attracted me most to the game was its ability to convey a rich, three dimensional world with relatively simple graphics. As a kid, one of my favourite TV shows was <cite>Secret City</cite>, in which <a href="http://www.markkistler.com/about.html">Commander Mark</a> led a cast of spacefaring adventurers who, inexplicably, spent all their time drawing. Each episode would introduce some new 3D drawing technique (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching">cross-hatching</a> was my favourite), and would end with Commander Mark adding some element to a large mural of a futuristic city. The mural would develop week-to-week, with each addition making use of the technique introduced in that episode. I'd love to see the finished product, if indeed it was ever finished.</p>
<p>Inspired by <cite>Secret City</cite>, I spent many classroom hours doodling heavily cross-hatched, futuristic suburbs in my excercise books. And when <cite>Marble Madness</cite> came along, it seemed as if those worlds had come to life.</p>
<p>Thanks to some serious snow shovelling (and a healthy dose of begging), I became the proud owner of a NES, but there was always some deeper, more exciting game around when I had money in my pocket to buy one. The <cite>Dragon Warrior</cite> series of games, in particular, kept me too short of time and money to finally get a dose of <cite>Marble Madness</cite>.</p>
<p>One day, it seemed as if my prayers had been answered. An ad in some game magazine offered a treasure trove of used "NES classics", seemingly for a pittance. I photocopied the page, checked off the necessary boxes, and sent off the modest sum that would bring <cite>Marble Madness</cite> flying to my doorstep. And fly it did--along with customs fees galore. The day we had to send the courier away with the game because of the outrageous import charges was a sad one.</p>
<p>Years later, games featuring simplistic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection">isometric 3D</a> worlds still hold an illogical attraction for me, and many such games have come and gone. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice_(video_game)">Solstice</a> (<a href="http://www.flyingomelette.com/reviews/nes/solstice.html">detailed review</a>) ended up taking over as the object of my obsession on NES. On the Super Nintendo (SNES), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActRaiser"><cite>Actraiser</cite></a>'s thin 3D simulation mode was worth playing through the frustrating action sections. On the PC, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000"><cite>SimCity 2000</cite></a> and other, similar games kept me playing in large part because of their isometric world views.</p>
<p>Though I don't have much time for games these days, <cite>Rolling Madness</cite> would have deserved at least a few hours of my time... except that it won't run on my computer. Despite up-to-date drivers and a fairly capable ATI Radeon 9800 Pro video card, launching the game presents me with a fatal error message:</p>
<blockquote><p>***ERROR: This program requires OpenGL version 1.21 or better. You have version 1.1. Please update the video card drivers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like if I want to play <cite>Marble Madness</cite>, the ame that started it all, I may have to bite the bullet and download an NES emulator.</p>
