In [Subspace Radio #62](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-62-captains-broken-by-tragedy-pro-2x11-15), Rob and I pass the time sailing on an ocean of vapour in episodes 11-15 of Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 by discussing other instances of captains bent and broken by tragedy. We discuss "The Doomsday Machine" (TOS), "The Omega Glory" (TOS), "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", "The Wounded" (TNG), "Equinox" (VOY) and the fundamental tragedies at the heart of captains Christopher Pike and Jean-Luc Picard.
