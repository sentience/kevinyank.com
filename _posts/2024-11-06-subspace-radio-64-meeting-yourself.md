In [Subspace Radio #64](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-64-meeting-yourself-ld-5x01-02), Rob and I review the first two episodes of Lower Decks Season 5, "Dos Cerritos" and "Shades of Green". We then revisit past Treks that saw our characters meeting themselves in various ways unrelated to the mirror universe. We discuss "The Enemy Within" (TOS), "Second Chances" (TNG), "Star Trek Nemesis" and "Defiant" (DS9).
