In [Subspace Radio #34](https://www.subspace.fm/episodes/episode-34-memory-loss-snw-2x04-among-the-lotus-eaters), Rob and I nearly lose ourselves in our analysis of "Among the Lotus Eaters", before dipping into other instances of our lead characters losing their memories, in "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", "The Changeling" (TOS), and "Conundrum" (TNG).
