      \  Hello Hypercritical gold tee owner. We have received word from a few of you that the size tag is clearly visible on the back of the shirt when worn. Itâ€™s not supposed to be like that. The size tag should be printed in a light color or light enough ink that it is not visible through the shirt when worn.\r

      \  \r

      \  If you received an incorrectly printed shirt and would like a replacement, please reply to this email by the end of this week (Friday, September 29). Please include a photo to confirm that the size tag can be seen through the shirt material when worn. We will happily replace the affected item. No need to return the original. Please allow a few weeks for us to print the new shirts. You will receive an email with tracking information once the replacement ships."
