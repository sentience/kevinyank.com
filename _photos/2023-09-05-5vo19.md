Last year's #Lamy scala infinite orange limited edition (1,350pcs) turns out to be the first of an annual tradition! Today Lamy released the scala majestic jade limited edition (1,500pcs) at retailers worldwide (except Australia, which trails behind as usual). I'm surprised that the size of the edition has increased, since infinite orange didn't sell out and is now being discounted all over the place. I continue to love the scala even though I agree it's over-priced. #fountainpens
