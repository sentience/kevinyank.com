I love that #Micropub (via #Indiekit) provides a standard, open API to post to my own site and syndicate to services like Mastodon. But I think I've tried all the Micropub clients out there, and none is anywhere near as a nice as, for example, using @marsedit@mastodon.social to post to WordPress. #indieweb could really use a killer app in the authoring tool space. #POSSE
