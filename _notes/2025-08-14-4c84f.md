Relieved to see [ScreenFlow is back from the dead](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/versions.htm?accordion=new) with a new 10.5 release that fixes the compatibility issues that were keeping me from using it on the current macOS. It's still my favourite app for editing and publishing screen recordings.
