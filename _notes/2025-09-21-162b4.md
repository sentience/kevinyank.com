Devoured the latest season of the [13 Minutes podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2), the first of which was a deconstruction of each of the 13 minutes it took Apollo 11 to descend from lunar orbit and land on the Moon. The new season 3 is all about the space shuttle program. As you'd expect, much of it is focused on Challenger, but there's plenty of fascinating detail about the early shuttle flights too.
