I was really excited about Photomator's ability to process RAW photos from my camera to HDR, leveraging the additional highlights detail. Unfortunately, Photomator saves these images in [a format that Apple Photos can't render consistently](https://www.pixelmator.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=40855). :( (Ping @pixelmator@mastodon.social)
