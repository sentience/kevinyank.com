I freed up a _ton_ of disk space on my Mac by enabling "Optimize Mac Storage" in Photos. But because I'll never entirely trust a cloud service with such precious data, I've set up [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://icloud-photos-downloader.github.io/icloud_photos_downloader/) on my Synology NAS to keep a full offline copy of all my photos.
