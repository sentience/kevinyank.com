Rewind.ai’s launch of Limitless.ai includes a lot of claims about privacy and encryption of your data, but as far as I can tell it sends a copy of “everything you see or hear” to OpenAI, where it is held in the open for 30 days for “monitoring and detecting abuse”. That doesn’t sound private to me, only anonymous. Think I’m going to have to cancel my preorder for their “privacy first” Pendant product.
