Feeling lucky to be attending the TechDiversity Awards tonight, helping to represent [Tech Career Paths 4 Girls](https://tcp4girls.com.au/), who are nominated for an award. I've been spending my Social Impact leave days at Culture Amp to help them polish up the videos that make up their choose-your-own-career experience for school-age girls.
