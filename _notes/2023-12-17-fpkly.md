Miyazaki’s The Boy And The Heron is both more accessible and more abstract than his previous “final film”, The Wind Rises. It’s worth seeing for the art alone, and if you go in expecting the story to disappoint I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. A worthy final work, if indeed that’s what it will be. 7/10
