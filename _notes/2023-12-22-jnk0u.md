While I consider #Mastodon's non-algorithmic Home timeline one of its most attractive features, I do occasionally want for an algorithmic "discovery view" (where the algorithm works in my interests, not the platform's). There are a few experiments like this out there, but nothing quite like what I'm imagining: surface toots and links based on favorites/reblogs/"quote toots" of people I follow (and people they follow). I'm tempted to try building it over the holidays to see if the feed it produces is any good.
