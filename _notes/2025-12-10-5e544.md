Finally gave [Raycast](https://raycast.com) a fair shake for a few weeks. It definitely has richer UI capabilities than my old pal [LaunchBar](https://obdev.at/launchbar), which makes me want to love it. The built in tutorial is incredibly good, for instance. But LaunchBar's “unified index” continues to be something I miss bitterly. Hit ⌘␣, then type the name of an app, a file, a contact, a website you recently visited or bookmarked… They're all in the same “root” search index! Every competitor (Alfred, Raycast, etc.) requires you to specify the kind of thing you're searching for _before_ you can type your search string. The Raycast manual specifically [calls this out as a design decision](https://manual.raycast.com/mac#Mac%20FAQs), but the tradeoff is just not one I can make. I'd also miss [Instant Send](https://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/InstantSend.html), but LaunchBar's unified index is really what removes all friction from macOS for me.
