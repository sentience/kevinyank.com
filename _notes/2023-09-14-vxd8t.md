Trying out [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev) to see if it can replace our hand-rolled tsc build to produce CJS+ESM packages. Fran√ßois Hendriks's [How To Make Tree Shakeable Libraries](https://blog.theodo.com/2021/04/library-tree-shaking/) gave me hard-to-find confirmation that we want to avoid bundling of our packages. Thankfully, tsup supports the option to disable bundling. #JavaScript
