Successfully added Apple CarPlay to my Tesla Model 3 (I know…) with a [little box](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009205865221.html) that injects the CarPay UI into the video signal for the centre screen. Feels great to be able to pick an episode from my Pocket Casts “up next” list while driving without having to touch my phone.
