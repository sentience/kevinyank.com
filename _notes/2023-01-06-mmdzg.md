I wish I knew why my macOS Accessibility permissions seem to get corrupted every week or so. I’ll reboot my machine, and the ~10 different apps that depend on Accessibility access complain they need to be allowed when they already are. `sudo tccutil reset Accessibility` resets everything so I can re-approve them … until it happens again. [This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/zagc9y/macos_ventura_im_asked_to_add_accessibility/) suggests it’s a macOS 13 Ventura bug.
