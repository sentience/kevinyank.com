Finally rolled credits on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth after 177 hours!! Definitely want to return to see some of the story branches I haven't explored and the few collectibles I missed, but I don't think I can see myself getting the platinum trophy on this one. The hard mode combat challenges are just too much work.
