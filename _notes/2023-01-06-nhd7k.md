Using #TailwindCSS in practice for the first time, I quickly find myself needing to comment groups of utility classes to help me remember why I’ve added them. I believe best practice is to extract these groups of styles into well-named components, which I’ll be doing here with Liquid partials.

Takeaway: Tailwind doesn’t take away the need to write your styles in a separate file or invent names for things; it merely lets you defer this until you’re past the designing-in-code phase.
