You’d think it would be easier to stand up a temporary HTTP proxy to capture requests for diagnostic purposes. I tried HTTP Toolkit and MockServer, and both wanted to munge the captured requests into more “readable” formats (like a JSON data structure) rather than letting me see the requests verbatim.
