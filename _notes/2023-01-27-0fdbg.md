Diving back into [JETT: The Far Shore](https://www.jett.fyi) on PS5. I can’t believe they haven’t corrected the fundamental design mistake they made of building a game where you need to navigate visually under pressure while at the same time reading a subtitled alien language. A re-voiced (in English) re-release of the original campaign is what is needed, but instead they’re doubling down with an expansion in the same format. Such a shame.
