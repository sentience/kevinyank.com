Sent my 2-week-old @playdate@panic.com in for warranty replacement in mid-September. When I chased @panic@panic.com for an update a few weeks later,  they said they were "making changes" to how they handle warranty replacements, and hoped to ship mine in "early November". I had to chase them for an update again when they missed that date, and now they're just saying "soon". ðŸ˜ž #Playdate
