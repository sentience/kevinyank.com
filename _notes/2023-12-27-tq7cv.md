#Amazon had two options for how to frame their #PrimeVideo pricing/ads change: “we’re adding ads but you can pay more to avoid them” or “we’re raising prices but we will introduce an ad tier if you prefer to save money”. It’s fascinating to me that they thought the ads-first option would be easier to swallow than the pricing-first version.
