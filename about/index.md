Hi, I’m Kevin Yank.

I’m a web geek living in Melbourne, Australia. I’ve been developing websites in one way or another since 1997. Over the years, I’ve worked on web frontends, web application backends, in server administration, managing product design, and I’ve even dabbled in desktop and mobile application development.

When I’m not coding or managing coders, I perform theatrical improvisation with [Impro Melbourne][im], where I’ve appeared in shows like _Theatresports™_, _Maestro™_, _Guerilla Theatre™_, and _Late Night Impro_ since 2005.

I’m best known for my work at [SitePoint][sitepoint], where I was Chief Technology Officer for over a decade (2002–2012). Besides writing a ton of code for the business, I wrote five editions of the book _[PHP & MySQL: Novice to Ninja][phpmysqlbook]_ (previously titled _Build Your Own Database Driven Website Using PHP & MySQL_), which together sold well over 25,000 copies. I co-wrote _[Simply JavaScript][jsbook]_ (2007), and contributed to _[Everything You Know About CSS Is Wrong!][csswrong]_ (2008) and _HTML Utopia: Designing Without Tables Using CSS_ (2003). I also wrote the weekly _SitePoint Tech Times_ email newsletter from 2002-2010, which went out to some 250,000 subscribers, and co-hosted the weekly _[SitePoint Podcast][sppodcast]_ (2008-2010).

More recently, I have created a number of online video courses, including _[Up and Running with Sublime Text 2][lyndast2]_ (2013), _Build Your First Website Using HTML & CSS_ (2011), _PHP Live_ (2010), _JavaScript Live_ (2010) and _The CSS Crash Course_ (2007).

I have also spoken at a number of industry events and conferences over the years, including [Web Directions South][wds] (2006, 2009), [Edge of the Web][eotw] (2009), and [Fundamentos Web][fundamentos] (2006).

I geek out on Macs.
